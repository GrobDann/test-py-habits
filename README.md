# 

A simple terminal-based Python program that helps track:
- Daily mood (1–10)
- Whether you coded today
- Whether you stayed clean today

## Features
- User input handling
- Conditional logic based on mood
- Case-insensitive input using `.lower()`
- Daily summary output

## Why I made this
I’m learning Python and wanted a small project to practice:
- Writing clean input logic
- Fixing bugs on my own
- Building consistency with daily coding
